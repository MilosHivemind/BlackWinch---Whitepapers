Instead, they would simply pay for the energy they use. In this model, the upfront capital expenditures, including the purchase and installation of panels, are borne by the provider rather than the customer. Additionally, the provider manages ongoing services, such as maintenance, repairs, and the eventual replacement of panels with newer, more energy-ef cient ones. - Furthermore, in industrial settings, the concept of \"Compressed Air-as-a-Service\" is slowly gaining traction, offering manufacturers exible access to compressed air without the burden of ownership.

Best practices for integration To successfully integrate data collection and analytics into existing PaaS offerings, organizations must follow several best practices that create a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making and service enhancement. Let\u2019s explore how companies can achieve this integration effectively. Starting with infrastructure setup, an industrial equipment provider must establish a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure to handle the massive volumes of data generated by connected devices. - Deploy a cloud-based solution that supports real-time data ingestion, storage, and processing and that serves the two sides of the service process: the end users and the service operators. By leveraging platforms like Servitly, manufacturers can harness the potential of IoT to deliver valuable connected products and services. - Ensure that the infrastructure is both exible and resilient, capable of scaling up during periods of high data ow and maintaining robust security protocols to protect sensitive information. This setup not only accommodates the immediate data needs but also future-proofs the business against growing data volumes as more devices and sensors come online. Selecting the right tools is equally critical for effective integration. For example, a company offering predictive maintenance services can bene t signi cantly from advanced analytics software designed to monitor equipment health and predict failures. Use tools providing powerful analytics capabilities, utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sensors and predict when maintenance is needed. This predictive capability minimizes downtime and extends the lifespan of equipment by addressing potential issues before they become critical. fl fl fi fl - fi fi fl fl fi www.blackwinch.eu Page 12 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"O3PyA4t-Ay3Vd-Nj":{"id":"O3PyA4t-Ay3Vd-Nj","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"6b5d0e3f9614fd6eb27359i144965586","page":0},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"O3PyA4t-Ay3Vd-Nj","hidden":false,"lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":476,"y":936,"width":127,"height":93},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF ","target":"_blank","showOptions":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.servitly.com\/"},"zIndex":40,"icon":{"default":{"id":"100"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":40,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"O3PyA4t-Ay3Vd-Nj","hidden":false,"lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":624,"y":943,"width":115,"height":86},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF ","target":"_blank","showOptions":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu"},"zIndex":41,"icon":{"default":{"id":"100"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":41,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"[WHITEPAPER] From data to decisions: Enhancing Product-As-A-Service in industrial and energy sectors Reading time: 12 minutes Yann Toutant & Stefano Butti ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"o90kood_nVfDMBIH":{"id":"o90kood_nVfDMBIH","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"6b5d0e3f9614fd6eb27359i144965586","page":5},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"o90kood_nVfDMBIH","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1043,"width":120,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":true},"zIndex":5,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":5,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"o90kood_nVfDMBIH","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1042,"width":121,"height":16},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":27,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":27,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"o90kood_nVfDMBIH","hidden":false,"lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":291,"width":133.75,"height":37.5},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF ","target":"_blank","showOptions":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.rolls-royce.com\/media\/our-stories\/discover\/2017\/totalcare.aspx"},"zIndex":45,"icon":{"default":{"id":"100"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":45,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"o90kood_nVfDMBIH","hidden":false,"lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":902,"width":41,"height":41},"action":29,"attributes":{"buttonLabel":"Find out more","color":"#E9831B","media":[],"discountPrice":"","price":"","url":"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/at\/Documents\/strategy-analytics\/at-equipment-as-service-2021.pdf","radius":3,"title":"Quote","description":"We have been talking about subscription models ever since Rolls-Royce pioneered its power by the hour concept in 1962, but we didn't have the technology to scale XaaS models until now.

Often discussed alongside concepts like leasing, rentals, and subscriptions, it is important to clarify what exactly as-a-service entails. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the term, as well as practical examples to illustrate its signi cance in the industrial and energy industries. Additionally, we will explore the role of data in maximizing the bene ts of this servitization model. 1. De ning Product-As-A-Service At its core, Product-As-A-Service is a business model where customers pay for the utility or outcome of a product rather than the product itself. This model leverages the principles of the circular economy, promoting sustainability and ef ciency by focusing on the product's performance and lifecycle rather than ownership. In a PaaS arrangement, the provider retains ownership and responsibility for the product, offering it to customers in a way that ensures optimal usage and minimal waste. A. Distinguishing PaaS from similar models - Leasing: Leasing involves a contractual agreement where the lessee pays the lessor for the use of an asset over a speci ed period. While leasing and PaaS both emphasize access over ownership, leasing typically does not usually include the comprehensive services and performance guarantees inherent in PaaS. - Rentals: Rentals provide short-term access to products with exible terms. Unlike PaaS, rentals are often temporary and do not focus on long-term performance or lifecycle management. PaaS, on the other hand, is structured to deliver ongoing value and service, integrating features such as regular maintenance, upgrades, and performance monitoring to enhance customer experience and sustainability. - Subscriptions: fl fi fi fi fi fi Subscription models allow customers to access services or products for a recurring fee. While subscriptions share similarities with PaaS in terms of recurring payments, they primarily apply to digital services or consumables (e.g., software, streaming services). PaaS extends this concept to physical products, emphasizing the delivery of tangible outcomes and sustained performance over mere access. www.blackwinch.eu Page 2 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"2d4gJL49YybUv58k":{"id":"2d4gJL49YybUv58k","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"6b5d0e3f9614fd6eb27359i144965586","page":4},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"2d4gJL49YybUv58k","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1043,"width":120,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":true},"zIndex":4,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":4,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"2d4gJL49YybUv58k","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1042,"width":121,"height":16},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":26,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":26,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"2d4gJL49YybUv58k","hidden":false,"lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":137,"width":603,"height":430},"action":103,"attributes":{"slideInterval":3,"loop":true,"hideBullets":false,"hideArrows":false,"autoplay":true,"media":[{"name":"Manufacturing.png","hash":"84bc064d6e3a0eaba8d0ea4f47342800"},{"name":"Construction.png","hash":"d52546595572f0c19a96067f47342801"},{"name":"Transportation.png","hash":"5bca1398a2831c370356e43f47342803"}],"scale":"fill","loading":false},"zIndex":44,"icon":{"default":{"id":"140"}},"type":67,"groupId":0,"id":44,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"3.
